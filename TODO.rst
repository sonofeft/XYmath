* ??? Add degrees of freedom to standard deviation calc.???
    - Data may or may not have error in it that needs DOF correction
    - for relative fit "goodness", may not want to penalize more terms.
    - for prediction interval calc, need to use DOF
    _ MAYBE... give user option for with or w/o DOF 

* Make links to Examples in General description areas

* Make up/down arrows work in Equation list boxes

* Compare best total error with best percent error

* Parameter guess-generator on non-linear fit page

* Add drop-down of typical non-linear eqns
    - Gaussien, Weibel, sinusoid, etc.

* Look at Prediction Interval (like matlab uses)
    - For putting bounds on extrapolation
    - also Confidence Intervals of curve itself

* Plot option for 1,2,3 sigma ranges

* Plot option for full X Range plot

* Add XYmath to system menu

* Figure out if mock logic does anything for ReadTheDocs failures

* Code gen option for python 2 & 3
